## Tips

1. When using multi-select, hold down shift and click the last color you want to select a whole bunch at once :3!
2. Make sure to always save in case it crashes too...This is vibe-coded, after all.
3. If Custom Palettes are loading weird:
   - Make sure you DID NOT MOVE THE PALS FOLDER INTO THE CUSTOM PALS FOLDER (don't do that!!!!!!!!!!!!)
   - Double check that the palette is correct in another palette editor and compare it to a vanilla of a
      similar type, including the transparent indexes
4. The icon editor's color imports are working now--just feel free to either quicksave or edit it immediately after 
   saving the pal and it should work correctly! Any bugs, let me know or put 'em in the Github!

      editor as possible. I know it was sloppy, I'm sorry
   - Should be fixed in v4.1

22. **TOO MANY BUTTONS!!!!**

      overwhelmed, too.
   - Option added to *show* excess buttons in v4.1

27. **Gradient button settings don't save when using the sliders**
   - Should be fixed in v4.2

28. **Many icons/pals still don't export properly from v4.1 prior!!**
   - HUGE update, with the documentation of it in the `AAA excess scripts` folder for you, in case you want to analyze it and submit fixes without looking at the code itself. Additionally, the rest of the ranges have been refactored in some way that are readable. So...
   - Should be fixed in v4.2, along with the icon translator
